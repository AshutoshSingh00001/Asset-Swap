## Asset Swap is a Dex building on Polkadot Asset Conversion Pallet
Polkadot Asset Hub is widely addopted by many different projects like USDT, USDC and many more these tokens are tradable on different Cex's like Binance but since we have asset conversion pallet live on kusama

Anyone can now create pools and convert tokens using asset conversion pallet to make it more accessible we came up with an idea to build a Dex UI for the asset conversion pallet

## How it Works
Asset Swap uses Polkadot JS Api to fetch chain storage data and let's users intract with multiple functionlities like ```createPool``` ```assetConversion``` And uses ```Extrinsics``` based calls to create and intract with different pairs of Assets
