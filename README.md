## Asset Swap is a Dex building on Polkadot Asset Conversion Pallet
Polkadot Asset Hub is widely adopted by many different projects like USDT, USDC. These tokens are tradable on different CEXs like Binance. But since we have the asset conversion pallet live on Kusama

Anyone can now create pools and convert tokens using the asset conversion pallet. To make it more accessible, we came up with an idea to build a DEX UI for the asset conversion pallet

## How it Works
Asset Swap uses Polkadot JS API to fetch chain storage data and lets users interact with multiple functionalities like ```createPool``` and ```assetConversion``` It uses ```extrinsics``` based calls to create and interact with different pairs of assets
